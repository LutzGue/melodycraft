# MelodyCraft

## Overview:

MelodyCraft is a Python-based project that empowers users to generate custom melodies effortlessly. The application provides a graphical user interface for users to define melody parameters, including key, number of measures, presence of an upbeat, melodic trajectory, and other customizable attributes.

## Key Features:

### User-Friendly Interface:

Intuitive graphical interface for seamless interaction.
Users can select the musical key, specify the number of measures, and decide on the presence of an upbeat.

### Melody Trajectory:

Unique feature allowing users to draw a curve representing the melodic trajectory using the Canvas component.
The drawn curve influences the melody generation process.

### Parameter Customization:

Users have granular control over melodic parameters such as tonality, number of measures, and presence of an upbeat.
Further customization includes specifying static tones, oscillation patterns, and focal points for each measure.

### Melody Generation:

The application processes user inputs and utilizes a melody generation algorithm to create both structured and embellished notes.
Structured notes follow the drawn curve, while embellishments enhance the musical expression.

### MIDI Output:

The generated melody is exported as a MIDI file for easy integration with various music software applications.

## How to Use:

Select the tonality (Major or Minor) and specify the desired number of measures.
Indicate whether an upbeat is desired and define its characteristics.
Use the Canvas to draw a curve representing the melodic trajectory.
Customize parameters for each measure, including static tones, oscillation patterns, and focal points.
Click the "Generate Melody" button to create a unique musical piece.
Getting Started:
